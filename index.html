    <P>Name: Father gascoigne</P>
    <P>HP: 2031</P>
    <P>Description: Father Gascoigne is an experienced hunter who has succumbed to the blood-drunkenness of the hunt and, as such, descended into a frenzied killing spree. He is armed with the Hunter Axe and a modified version of the Hunter Pistol that acts like the Hunter Blunderbuss, and he also wears his titular Gascoigne's Set.Despite his title, he is not a Healing Church priest. This is referenced in his attire's description</P>
    <P>Lore: Gascoigne was a priest in a foreign land, where he earned the title of "Father". At some point in his life, Gascoigne travelled to Yharnam and eventually joined the Healing Church as a hunter. From here, Gascoigne was partnered with Henryk, an older hunter. The two made an effective duo, and their partnership led to Henryk's 'tragically' long life.

        At some point, Father Gascoigne took a wife by the name of Viola and the pair had children. As Gascoigne continued to hunt, he became affected by the bloodlust, forgetting even his family. Viola was known to play a Tiny Music Box, a memento of theirs, in order to draw him home when he had been out all night, helping him remember her and their children when he began succumbing to the bloodlust. Their daughter, the Young Girl, still resides in Central Yharnam, unless the Hunter sends her to Iosefka's Clinic, where she becomes a Celestial Minion, or Oedon Chapel, where she will be killed by the Maneater Boar. The Tiny Music Box will be given to the Hunter when speaking with the Young Girl and can be used against Father Gascoigne to stun him during battle.
       
        During his final hunt, Gascoigne finally succumbed to the bloodlust, becoming little more than the beasts he had hunted. Viola left their home in order to search for her husband but forgot her music box. Her body is found in the Tomb of Oedon, near to where Gascoigne is hacking away at corpses until the Hunter puts him down. It is unclear whether he killed his wife or the beastly scourge did; nonetheless, her loss cost him his humanity.</P>

    <img style="border-style: double;color: red;width: 450px;" src="/imagens/clericbeast2.gif">
    <p>Name: Cleric beast</p>
    <p>HP: 3015</p>
    <P>Description: The Cleric Beast is a huge creature with hideous, twisted horns, matted fur and a malnourished figure, and emits shrieks that sound like cries of agony. Although at first glance the Cleric Beast appears to have an emaciated and almost skeletal body, this monster has high agility, supernatural strength and a sizable amount of health. It is one of the first bosses encountered in the game, and the first boss to be revealed during the game's development.</P>
    <p>Lore: The Cleric Beast owes its name to a rumor that it was originally a member of Yharnam's clergy transformed by the old blood.[1] After defeating the Cleric Beast, one obtains the Sword Hunter Badge which states in its description:

        "One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church. The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter. Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to come, many of Whom were clerics. As it was, clerics transformed into the most hideous beasts."[2]
       
        This suggests that the Cleric Beast was a member of the Healing Church and possibly a hunter employed under Ludwig that succumbed to the scourge of the beast, leading to their descent into beasthood.</p>

    <p>Name: Blood-Starved Beast</p>
    <p>HP: 3470</p>
    <p>Description: The Blood-starved Beast is a deformed, quadrupedal creature whose skin is peeled off and hanging from its back. Much like the Cleric Beast, it also has a malnourished, skeletal appearance. However, unlike the latter, the Blood-starved Beast fought as a boss is so malnourished and devoid of blood that it instead bleeds poison. Although it may look like a weak creature at first sight, its erratic and nimble movements make it a formidable foe for hunters.
    The Blood-starved Beast is generally the third or fourth boss of the game depending on how the player explores the Cathedral Ward.</p>
    <p>Lore: It is suggested that the Blood-starved Beast was a person receiving blood healing as a part of rituals performed by Healing Church members in Old Yharnam in order to learn more about the Great Ones and the effects of blood healing. This is demonstrated a corpse of another Blood-Starved Beast can be found crucified and chained in the small chapel of Old Yharnam.

        Moreover, below the corpse, the player finds ritual blood. This suggests that the Blood-starved Beast has some connection to ritualistic practices performed by the Healing Church and has some significance to Blood-Healing and its administration. In this case, it is well possible that these Beasts "must" be skinned alive in order to collect their blood without killing them, since they would simply regenerate minor cuts or surgical shunts.
       
        It is not unlikely that these beasts were once Blood Saints, the Healing Church's nuns chosen to be sources of healing blood: this would explain both why these beings are "blood starved" (they were skinned to take their blood) and why there are similarities to the Female Beast Patients.
       
        In Bloodborne: The Death of Sleep, a specific Blood-starved Beast relentlessly pursues the hunter and The Child on their travels until it is finally put down by the latter.</p>

    <P style="color: rgb(56, 0, 0);font-size: 15px;">wife material :3</P>
    <p>Name: Vicar Amelia</p>
    <p>HP: 5367</p>
    <p>Description: Vicar Amelia is a high-ranking member of the Healing Church, the successor of Laurence, and to whom his Gold Pendant has been passed down.

        In stark contrast with the Beast Patients, people that slowly turn into monsters under layers of bandages, this woman shows perfectly what happens when a human mutates suddenly into a full-fledged Beast: at first Amelia is seen as a normal human woman with tattered white robes, kneeling and reciting a prayer, but after a few instants she changes abruptly. Her skin ruptures under the force of her new body, splattering blood all around her: now another kind of Cleric Beast, her ash blonde hair has become a long wild mane while her face, covered by scraps of her clothes like the rest of her body, has turned into a lupine head with thin antlers and a slasher smile of sharp teeth.
       
        She can extend her claws like a cat, and they are sharp and hard enough to emit sparks while grinding on stone. Her arms are powerful as well, being able to create a strong shockwave by smashing them to the floor.
       
        The same Gold Pendant that she still clutches proves to be more than a simple locket: Amelia is able to use it to channel energy in order to start healing her wounds in a pillar of golden light, thus making it function similarly to a Hunter Tool.
       
        As a "True" Beast she will take extra damage from Fire and Serration damage</p>

        Sword and Candle
        2302|

        2046</p>
    <p>Description: The Shadow of Yharnam consists of three figures shrouded in black robes. As the fight progresses they are revealed to have been infected with the parasitic snakes that infest the woods and undergo gruesome mutations. They share a symbiotic link with the vipers, either transforming their arms to use them as whips or summoning gigantic serpents to devour victims.

        This fight involves three enemies, all of which are vulnerable to Bolt-type attacks.
       
        Shadow #1: Uses a mace and casts long-range, semi-homing fireballs.
        Shadow #2: Wields a large scimitar and a candlestick that acts as a flamethrower.
        Shadow #3: Uses only a large scimitar, but is the most aggressive of the three.</p>
    <p>Lore: They are servants of Queen Yharnam, as their name implies. However, unlike other Shadows, they are infested with the parasytic snakes found inside the Forbidden Woods, making them a tough challenge when compared to the other Shadows.</p>

    <img style="border-style: double;color: red;width: 450px;" src="/imagens/gehrman2.gif">
    <p>Name: Gehrman the first hunter</p>
    <p>HP: 14293</p>
    <p>Description: An elderly man bound to a wheelchair, Gehrman is a mysterious character who appears to act as the Hunter's guide throughout the game. This character was briefly seen for the first time in the reveal trailer and he was seen a second time in the final seconds of the Gamescom trailer, accompanied by his assistant.

        Gehrman has shoulder-length, grey hair and wears a black hat along with a brown leather jacket and trousers, a tattered mantle and a scarf. He can always be seen bound to an ornate wheelchair and he carries a cane with him. Also, his right foot is missing, replaced by what appears to be a peg leg.
       
        Gehrman is found for the first time at the Hunter's Dream. After the hunter visits this location for the second time, they will find Gehrman inside the previously locked mansion. The elderly man will recognize the player as "the new hunter" and will encourage them to kill a few beasts. He will provide them with hints and information if the Hunter speaks with him</p>
    <p>Lore: At the start of the beast scourge, Gehrman was the first of the Yharnamites to take notice of the beasts and became the first hunter. His garb tells us that by making adjustments to his everyday clothing and tools, Gehrman equipped himself to hunt the beasts. He became a well-known pioneer in the field of hunting beasts, taking up responsibility as a teacher and weapon designer. One of his most prominent apprentices was a woman who was distantly related to Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods, the Rakuyo wielding hunter, Lady Maria. Gehrman had a curious mania over Maria, which she was unaware of.

        As the plague spread and more people became aware of it, the church began sending out specially-sanctioned hunters of their own, and even recruited civilians to join the hunt. Soon enough, Gehrman and his workshop became invalidated as the church set up a workshop of their own. Sometime after Lady Maria went missing after the event at Fishing Hamlet. Gehrman, in his grief, called upon a Great One to help him bring life to The Doll, and with its assistance via a contract created the Hunter's Dream. The Doll, however, proved not enough to sate Gehrman's longing of Maria's return, and he soon became bitter of her presence. As the hunt dragged on and hundreds of hunters came and went, Gehrman realized he was bound to the dream and could never escape it. In his sleep he pleads to Master Willem and Laurence to free him from the dream.
       
        At the end of the game, Gehrman offers to free the Hunter from the nightmare and return them to the waking world. Three different endings are possible, depending on which answer is given:
       
        Choosing to accept Gehrman's offer unlocks the Yharnam Sunrise ending. Gehrman uses his scythe to behead the player, who then awakens in the real Yharnam as the sun rises. In the Hunter's Dream, The Doll bids the Hunter farewell, wishing them well in the waking world.
        Choosing to refuse Gehrman's offer unlocks the Honoring Wishes ending. Disappointed with the player, Gehrman initiates a battle. After Gehrman is defeated, the Moon Presence arrives and devours the Hunter. Some time later, The Doll is seen pushing the player, now sitting in Gehrman's wheelchair, back to the Workshop in the Hunter's Dream. The Doll remarks that a new Hunt will begin, signifying that the player has taken Gehrman's place in guiding other hunters.
        If three One Third of Umbilical Cords were consumed and Gehrman's offer is refused, the Childhood's Beginning ending is unlocked. After Gehrman is defeated, the Moon Presence arrives to devour the Hunter, but the Hunter resists. The Moon Presence then initiates a battle. Upon its defeat, the Hunter is transformed into an infant Great One, destined to replace the Moon Presence in the Hunter's Dream.</p>
